You should place your nginx-proxy configuration files here. 
Use files literally named [domain] and [domain]_location.

[domain] will be replaced internally by the effective configured 
domain ({$DOCKER_DEVBOX_DOMAIN_PREFIX}.{$DOCKER_DEVBOX_DOMAIN}), and files 
will be installed to the nginx-proxy container.
